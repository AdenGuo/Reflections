What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creat a hidden folder in my working directory and ready to track all the file under my working 
	directory. Because this action will turn a normal directory into a git repository. I can use git 
	system in this folder.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you 
think it offers?
	Staging area are actually marks of files that indicat files will be committed. It only contain files 
	in current directory. The repository is the directory that be tracked by the git system. I think staging
	area act like a buffer for commit. One can add files or remove file from this area depending on the work 
	flow. Finale commit will be performed on the staging area. So one can orgnize every commit very well by 
	using this staging area.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	I can check my stage area and compare difference bewtteen working directory and staging area to make sure 
	the changes I make can orgnize into a logical one. 
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When i want to do some thing brand new and do not to modify the current setting of the program. Also 
	branches help programmer to organize the flow of development. Different branches may correspond to different 
	methods of the programs.
